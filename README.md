This is a for fun project I was doing to try and port over IronmarioTracker to any other emulator, I started with pj64. It is unfinished and has a lot left to be done.  It now overlays over Parallel.

Please check out the original source when you can. You may do as you wish with this project. I don't actually mind if others want to help continue with this.

Example of just the text overlay in parallel, Does not currently work. Still need the address values:
